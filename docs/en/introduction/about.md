> First, take a look at MapStruct:
> [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org) is a code generator that automatically implements the concrete logic of property conversion by defining an interface for class conversion. Mainly to simplify the implementation of conversion between Java types.

MapStructPlus is an enhancement tool of MapStruct, on the basis of MapStruct, it realizes the function of automatically generating Mapper interface, and strengthens some functions, making Java type conversion more convenient and elegant.

Like MapStruct, it is essentially JSR 269 based Java annotation handler, so triggers can be built by Maven、Gradle、Ant and so on.

MapStructPlus is embedded with MapStruct, fully compatible with MapStruct, and can seamlessly replace dependencies if you have previously used MapStruct.
